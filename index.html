    		Peace be with you!<br>
            I make this non-profit site, in order to present my literary works. It is made up of a Chronic part, a Talmud part and a Miscellaneous / Other part. The Talmud part is a kind of ... New Generation Remix of the Talmud, even if some references will be true, the discussion in itself is FICTIVE and does not act as law or religious source, because it is a question of 'a Fictional Talmud written in a Talmudic style with some real references to Judaism.<br>
            The Chronicle part is made up of different fictional stories but in a historical-religious context. Indeed in these stories will happen in a real historical context, or a recognized religious context, with fictitious but also real characters such as Kings David and Solomon, prophets etc ... God will also be in these stories in the sense where He will speak.<br>
            <br>
            It is important to emphasize to the religious communities that there is NO Blasphemous GOAL there, these are FICTIVE stories, even if God or certain characters quoted are real, The Story and The Words held are FICTIVE and are not a reliable theological source, or an attempt to modify, transform, change, the biblical and Koranic writings.<br>
            By validating the alert for access to the site, you have acknowledged that you are fully aware of the FICTIVE nature of the documents below. I respect everyone's beliefs, I have a deep respect for religious writings and religions, that's why I would not allow myself to blaspheme or incite the mockery of respected religious figures such as the prophets.<br>
            There are indeed some comic tales which could be considered by the most radical, fundamentalist, extremist as blasphemy. It has nothing of it, they are once again FICTIVE scenes and even if their readings can be surprising or shocking or quite simply comic, ironic, it is not question to BELIEVE that God or Such Prophet has REALLY said this / that, NO, the historical religious context is real, certain characters are real, however THE SCENARIO, The Course and the Words are FICTIVE.<br>
            <br>
            The category 'Miscellaneous/Other', is composed of some of my rap texts, poems, philosophical reflections ... These works are to be taken seriously and have almost nothing fictional ...

			<legend>Story #3 Mesopotamian War (Fictional)</legend>
    		<p>
                One day in the arid plains of the Mesopotamian steppe, a great battle took place which opposed the Ottomans against the armies reputed invincible of the Princes of the East Amine and Adrian...<br>
                The Ottomans were, despite their strategic inferiority, twice as numerous...<br>
                Prince Adrian the Indo-Israelite and Prince Amine the Ismaili were, despite their difference in culture, loyal allies towards each other and when they were both united they inspired Respect and Fear...<br>
                But Ottoman King Mürat Tunç IV dared to provoke them...<br>
                But the two princes apart from being fine strategists were sincere believers and despite their difference in religion they prayed to the same God, The One and Eternal Creator.<br>
                They then addressed their prayers to him...<br>
                And War started...<br>
                The Ottoman army suffered heavy losses, but the two princes understood that the end was near for them if they did not sound the retreat ... King Mürat took the opportunity to attack in treachery the Prince Amine by firing an arrow in his back, however An Unknown soldier of Prince Adrian's Israelite army threw himself and sacrificed himself to save Prince Amine who suddenly turned around...<br>
                The Princes looked at each other in desperation on the verge of death and prayed one last time observing the vultures which hovered above them...<br>
                <em>"Achadou anla ilaha ila-lah! Wa achadou 'ana Muhammadan rassouloulah!"</em> shouted Prince Amine.<br>
                <em>"Chmaa Israel Adonaï Éloéïnou Adonaï éhad"</em> shouted Prince Adrian.<br>
                Then suddenly columns of light coming from Heaven treated all the soldiers of the two princes and Prophet Azaria (may his Wisdom enlighten us) arrived on the scene.<br>
                Allah Al-Mani <small>(soubhanahou wa ta'ala)</small> expressed himself in his words: <em>"Azaria, go now to the battlefield by raising your hands to heaven and reciting the words that I taught you on Mount Targon, you will thus walk in a circle around the Ottoman army and no attack will attain you."</em><br>
                Azariah the Prophet <small>(may his Courage be Honored</small> carried out and accomplished the task that Allah Aaza-wa-jall had entrusted to him with an implacable Faith...<br>
                Wherever Azaria walked it created a trail of flowery greenery despite the dry and hot sandy soil ... the Ottomans tried to kill The Prophet but in vain ... once finished, the entire Ottoman army was surrounded by a simple circle green grass and multicolored flowers...<br>
                However the soldiers who tried to leave the circle died instantly... the Ottomans were trapped and it only remained to finish them...<br>
                "Allahu Akbar!" shouted Prince Amine and his army.<br>
                "Elohim Gadol" exclaimed Prince Adrian and his army...<br>
                <br>
                Thus the great battle of Mesopotamia ended with the head of the Fallen King Mürat Tunç IV as a trophy planted on a spear in the middle of the magic circle drawn by Azaria (may His Faith be our example).<br>
                Following these moments Princes Adrian and Amine learned Humility, that one should not underestimate their adversaries, then that War is synonymous with Death.

			<legend>Story #4 Optic Book Surah 2000 (Fictional)</legend>
    		<p>
    			One day, the great sages and priests of the Israelite and Ishmaelite Kingdoms weakened in their clairvoyance and suffered from vision problems ... The high Israelite priest could not even read the Torah anymore and the High Ishmaelite priest could no longer read the Koran ... Princes Adrian and Amine <small>(may their Courage be glorified)</small> met in the Steppes of Sarawat in Yemen where they discussed the situation while drinking tea near an Oasis. Seeing no solution, they made the decision to turn to God <small>(may His Name be sanctified)</small>.<br>
                The two princes then rode to the Mesopotamian plains where the Lord <small>(may His Holiness be praised)</small> came to their aid via a miracle through a prophet...<br>
                So they entered the circle of multicolored flowers which was miraculously still intact despite the weather and the hellish heat. there was a pleasant freshness inside.<br>
                The two Princes prayed according to their rites, customs and religions which were different but linked by the same Faith in God <small>(may His Divinity protect us)</small>.<br>
                They prayed for 4 days without interruption because they no longer felt hunger, thirst or fatigue in the circle...<br>
                The persistence of Princes Amine and Adrian <small>(let their Patience be an example)</small> paid off.<br>
                A gigantic Sand Tornado formed before them but attracted nothing around it ... Allah <small>(may His Power be claimed)</small> expressed himself in these terms: <em>"My sons, brave warriors, Young Kings that you will become... your dedication in your prayers and your solidarity touched me... You represent The Hope and Honor of the Children of Avraham... You Amine son of Ishmael</em> <small>(peace be upon him)</small> <em>and You Adrian Son of Jacob</em> <small>(peace be upon him)</small> <em>your Indestructible Friendship is a source of Peace and Prosperity for the people of Israel and Ishmaelite. Your Brotherhood honors you ... So go home and help will be waiting for you."</em><br>
                The shocked and flattered princes whom Allah <small>(praise Him)</small> in person replied to them hastened to execute the Divine Word and returned.<br>
                Upon their return, Prophet Azaria <small>(may his Wisdom enlighten us)</small> greeted them with Joy.<br>
                The prophet observed the eyes of the two High Priests and stretched out his hands towards the sky and two objects arrived in his hands, <em>"By the Grace of Allah"</em> shouted the Prophet Azariah <small>(may His Faith be gratified)</small>.<br>
                These strange objects looked like nothing known... two circles of glasses surrounded by a thin metal then followed by two curved branches... The prophet installed this object on the face of the High Priests, it was placed on the nose, the glass circles were located in front of the eyes and the two branches hung behind the ears...<br>
                <em>"What an amazing object"</em> exclaimed the two Fascinated and Intrigued Princes.<br>
                <em>"The View returns to us it's a Miracle!"</em> The two High Priests exclaimed with joy... <br>
                <em>"We will call this object... glaffes"</em> humbly declared the Prophet Azaria (that his Culture teaches us).<br>
                And this is how The View, The Clairvoyance of the Two Kingdoms was found and a Banquet was organized in the Honor of God <small>(may He be sanctified)</small>, of his prophet and of the two princes.
