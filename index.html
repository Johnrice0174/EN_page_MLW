    		Peace be with you!<br>
            I make this non-profit site, in order to present my literary works. It is made up of a Chronic part, a Talmud part and a Miscellaneous / Other part. The Talmud part is a kind of ... New Generation Remix of the Talmud, even if some references will be true, the discussion in itself is FICTIVE and does not act as law or religious source, because it is a question of 'a Fictional Talmud written in a Talmudic style with some real references to Judaism.<br>
            The Chronicle part is made up of different fictional stories but in a historical-religious context. Indeed in these stories will happen in a real historical context, or a recognized religious context, with fictitious but also real characters such as Kings David and Solomon, prophets etc ... God will also be in these stories in the sense where He will speak.<br>
            <br>
            It is important to emphasize to the religious communities that there is NO Blasphemous GOAL there, these are FICTIVE stories, even if God or certain characters quoted are real, The Story and The Words held are FICTIVE and are not a reliable theological source, or an attempt to modify, transform, change, the biblical and Koranic writings.<br>
            By validating the alert for access to the site, you have acknowledged that you are fully aware of the FICTIVE nature of the documents below. I respect everyone's beliefs, I have a deep respect for religious writings and religions, that's why I would not allow myself to blaspheme or incite the mockery of respected religious figures such as the prophets.<br>
            There are indeed some comic tales which could be considered by the most radical, fundamentalist, extremist as blasphemy. It has nothing of it, they are once again FICTIVE scenes and even if their readings can be surprising or shocking or quite simply comic, ironic, it is not question to BELIEVE that God or Such Prophet has REALLY said this / that, NO, the historical religious context is real, certain characters are real, however THE SCENARIO, The Course and the Words are FICTIVE.<br>
            <br>
            The category 'Miscellaneous/Other', is composed of some of my rap texts, poems, philosophical reflections ... These works are to be taken seriously and have almost nothing fictional ...

			<legend>Story #3 Mesopotamian War (Fictional)</legend>
    		<p>
                One day in the arid plains of the Mesopotamian steppe, a great battle took place which opposed the Ottomans against the armies reputed invincible of the Princes of the East Amine and Adrian...<br>
                The Ottomans were, despite their strategic inferiority, twice as numerous...<br>
                Prince Adrian the Indo-Israelite and Prince Amine the Ismaili were, despite their difference in culture, loyal allies towards each other and when they were both united they inspired Respect and Fear...<br>
                But Ottoman King Mürat Tunç IV dared to provoke them...<br>
                But the two princes apart from being fine strategists were sincere believers and despite their difference in religion they prayed to the same God, The One and Eternal Creator.<br>
                They then addressed their prayers to him...<br>
                And War started...<br>
                The Ottoman army suffered heavy losses, but the two princes understood that the end was near for them if they did not sound the retreat ... King Mürat took the opportunity to attack in treachery the Prince Amine by firing an arrow in his back, however An Unknown soldier of Prince Adrian's Israelite army threw himself and sacrificed himself to save Prince Amine who suddenly turned around...<br>
                The Princes looked at each other in desperation on the verge of death and prayed one last time observing the vultures which hovered above them...<br>
                <em>"Achadou anla ilaha ila-lah! Wa achadou 'ana Muhammadan rassouloulah!"</em> shouted Prince Amine.<br>
                <em>"Chmaa Israel Adonaï Éloéïnou Adonaï éhad"</em> shouted Prince Adrian.<br>
                Then suddenly columns of light coming from Heaven treated all the soldiers of the two princes and Prophet Azaria (may his Wisdom enlighten us) arrived on the scene.<br>
                Allah Al-Mani <small>(soubhanahou wa ta'ala)</small> expressed himself in his words: <em>"Azaria, go now to the battlefield by raising your hands to heaven and reciting the words that I taught you on Mount Targon, you will thus walk in a circle around the Ottoman army and no attack will attain you."</em><br>
                Azariah the Prophet <small>(may his Courage be Honored</small> carried out and accomplished the task that Allah Aaza-wa-jall had entrusted to him with an implacable Faith...<br>
                Wherever Azaria walked it created a trail of flowery greenery despite the dry and hot sandy soil ... the Ottomans tried to kill The Prophet but in vain ... once finished, the entire Ottoman army was surrounded by a simple circle green grass and multicolored flowers...<br>
                However the soldiers who tried to leave the circle died instantly... the Ottomans were trapped and it only remained to finish them...<br>
                "Allahu Akbar!" shouted Prince Amine and his army.<br>
                "Elohim Gadol" exclaimed Prince Adrian and his army...<br>
                <br>
                Thus the great battle of Mesopotamia ended with the head of the Fallen King Mürat Tunç IV as a trophy planted on a spear in the middle of the magic circle drawn by Azaria (may His Faith be our example).<br>
                Following these moments Princes Adrian and Amine learned Humility, that one should not underestimate their adversaries, then that War is synonymous with Death.

			<legend>Story #4 Optic Book Surah 2000 (Fictional)</legend>
    		<p>
    			One day, the great sages and priests of the Israelite and Ishmaelite Kingdoms weakened in their clairvoyance and suffered from vision problems ... The high Israelite priest could not even read the Torah anymore and the High Ishmaelite priest could no longer read the Koran ... Princes Adrian and Amine <small>(may their Courage be glorified)</small> met in the Steppes of Sarawat in Yemen where they discussed the situation while drinking tea near an Oasis. Seeing no solution, they made the decision to turn to God <small>(may His Name be sanctified)</small>.<br>
                The two princes then rode to the Mesopotamian plains where the Lord <small>(may His Holiness be praised)</small> came to their aid via a miracle through a prophet...<br>
                So they entered the circle of multicolored flowers which was miraculously still intact despite the weather and the hellish heat. there was a pleasant freshness inside.<br>
                The two Princes prayed according to their rites, customs and religions which were different but linked by the same Faith in God <small>(may His Divinity protect us)</small>.<br>
                They prayed for 4 days without interruption because they no longer felt hunger, thirst or fatigue in the circle...<br>
                The persistence of Princes Amine and Adrian <small>(let their Patience be an example)</small> paid off.<br>
                A gigantic Sand Tornado formed before them but attracted nothing around it ... Allah <small>(may His Power be claimed)</small> expressed himself in these terms: <em>"My sons, brave warriors, Young Kings that you will become... your dedication in your prayers and your solidarity touched me... You represent The Hope and Honor of the Children of Avraham... You Amine son of Ishmael</em> <small>(peace be upon him)</small> <em>and You Adrian Son of Jacob</em> <small>(peace be upon him)</small> <em>your Indestructible Friendship is a source of Peace and Prosperity for the people of Israel and Ishmaelite. Your Brotherhood honors you ... So go home and help will be waiting for you."</em><br>
                The shocked and flattered princes whom Allah <small>(praise Him)</small> in person replied to them hastened to execute the Divine Word and returned.<br>
                Upon their return, Prophet Azaria <small>(may his Wisdom enlighten us)</small> greeted them with Joy.<br>
                The prophet observed the eyes of the two High Priests and stretched out his hands towards the sky and two objects arrived in his hands, <em>"By the Grace of Allah"</em> shouted the Prophet Azariah <small>(may His Faith be gratified)</small>.<br>
                These strange objects looked like nothing known... two circles of glasses surrounded by a thin metal then followed by two curved branches... The prophet installed this object on the face of the High Priests, it was placed on the nose, the glass circles were located in front of the eyes and the two branches hung behind the ears...<br>
                <em>"What an amazing object"</em> exclaimed the two Fascinated and Intrigued Princes.<br>
                <em>"The View returns to us it's a Miracle!"</em> The two High Priests exclaimed with joy... <br>
                <em>"We will call this object... glaffes"</em> humbly declared the Prophet Azaria (that his Culture teaches us).<br>
                And this is how The View, The Clairvoyance of the Two Kingdoms was found and a Banquet was organized in the Honor of God <small>(may He be sanctified)</small>, of his prophet and of the two princes.

			<legend>Story #5 Fraternity (Fictional)</legend>
    		<p>
    			It was at the time of the provisional and very short reign of King Ilan Ben Renada which was established as a transition by the Cohanim and the Wise Men to guarantee a transition of power in good conditions from the disorientation of the fallen King Roboam Ben Salomon Ben David to that of future King Jeroboam the proletarian.<br>
                The Kingdom of Israel then known dark days following the breaking of the Royal line of David <small>(עליו השלום)</small>.<br>
                However, King Ilan Ben Renada was advised by the Indo-Israelite prince Adrian Ben Yitro, the prophet Larry Ben Mickael The Scholar <small>(may his knowledge enlighten us)</small>, the Israelite princesses Jessie Bat Sarah, The Gentle <small>(may his calm and his patience are an example)</small>, Isa Capernaüm <small>(The Rigorous)</small>, Sabrina Bat Véred H'aïm <small>(The Kind)</small>, Floriane Bat Rahel <small>(The Fair)</small> and Alva Bat Sarah <small>(The couragous converted)</small>.<br>
                The Peace in the region of Canaan that King Solomon Ben David had distributed and guaranteed, then began to dissolve after his death. The pagan peoples began to threaten the Kingdom of Israel and even urged the Ishmaelites who lived among the Israelites to rebel and massacre all the pretenders to the Throne in order to take power.<br>
                Following the death of King Solomon <small>(עליו השלום)</small>, an Israelite army officer named Yoni Tzioni <small>(nicknamed The Kitsoni by his entourage)</small> proclaimed himself General of Armies and has threatened of death all the Ishmaelites of the Kingdom for Rebellion <small>(even if he had planned to spare all those who were recognized for having served the Kingdom in Peace and Fraternity)</small>. Of course he imprisoned his former hierarchical superiors who opposed him by insulting them of leftists <small>(a word that made no sense at the time)</small>.<br>
                <br>
                The Lord <small>(ברוך הוא וברוך שמו)</small> spoke to Larry Ben Mickael in these words: <em>"I cannot tolerate the spread of innocent blood on this pure land which I promised to your fathers, you will therefore advise the young king Ilan Ben Renada to forbid the army any violence against the Ishmaelite people which results from the blessing of Ishmael their father whom I blessed and whom you will love as Avraham did before you. However, it is necessary to remove all harmful influence from my beloved people, therefore you will advise the King to order the expulsion of the Ishmaelites from the Kingdom, that they leave with their goods, food and water. That’s My will. Concerning Prince Adrian Ben Yitro, you will tell him that he will go find the Ishmaelite Ahmed Panda the Wise so that he will ensure that his people leave the Kingdom in Peace as I have ordered. And finally, Prince Adrian should go find the young Hayce Kioub the Erudite, the Wise, the Righteous, he will guide with the Sage Ahmed Panda the Ishmaelites expelled in the way of good, respect for tolerance and love towards their Israelite brothers by the teaching of my commandments."</em><br>
                <br>
                The prophet Larry Ben Michael carried out the will of the Lord <small>(ברוך הוא וברוך שמו)</small>.<br>
                The Israelites were disturbed, angry, and Jeroboam should had to quickly ascend to the throne as God intended <small>(ברוך הוא וברוך שמו)</small> to punish Solomon for his faults by removing his descendants from the throne.<br>
                The young temporary King Ilan Ben Renada tried to comfort the people. He ordered the two richest and holders of land, Yéremiahou <small>(also called Paliwood)</small> and Ivri Anohi to organize a Royal banquet intended for All the people in order for the King Ilan to talk to them (the people) when this one is satisfied and listening in peace.<br>
                Yéremiahou and Ivri Anohi fulfilled the task that the king asked them and have invited the H'akhamim (Wises) of the people including the famous Albator Ashkenazi <small>(may his knowledge enlighten us)</small>, Vendetta Guetta <small>(may his knowledge enlighten us)</small> as well as his friend and raises Ezra ben Azhakian (The Scholar).<br>
                <br>
                At that time, idolatry flooded the world as always because the People chosen by God was closed in on itself and did not fulfill the role which fell to it by transmitting to the World the knowledge of the Eternal, The Unique <small>(ברוך הוא וברוך שמו)</small> through the 7 Noahid laws.<br>
                However, isolated cases appeared. A priest from the African islands, the priest Nicholson, as well as a priest from a distant land Cosme Le Simple, then another priest from Edom Speravi-Septim had understood from a very young age the falsity of local practices and have dedicated their lives to One God Creator and Master of the World <small>(ברוך הוא וברוך שמו)</small>. They traveled desperately seeking a place in this world where he would be accepted for their belief. They heard rumors about a people out of slavery by a deity who performed miracles and that the kingdom of Israel as well as of Judah were the accomplishment of their perilous journey and being located in the land of Canaan, the Levantine in common language.<br>
                So the courageous priests Nicholson and Cosme and Speravi-Septim, the Pious found refuge in the Kingdom of Israel and became friends with the Prophet Larry Ben Mickael who addressed them these words: <em>"Welcome to you servants of Lord, you are distinguished guests here and you can stay with us as much as you like because you have followed the path of Abraham and Yitro, renouncing local practices to recognize and worship only the One and Only God"</em>.<br>
                After the people's banquet, Jeroboam, elected from the People and from God <small>(ברוך הוא וברוך שמו)</small> to govern, went up on the platform next to King Ilan and asked the People to calm down and be patient because King Ilan govern only by transition and that the divine will will be accomplished in due time.<br>
                <br>
                A few days later, the surrounding people noticed that the Ismaelite rebellion was not felt and that the Israelite people had regained their calm, they plotted and placed catapults and archers near the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah.<br>
                The people were ready to defend themselves and help the army but it is true that the fear was growing and that the end was near ... The prophet Larry Ben Michael reassured the young king Ilan ben Renada who was also afraid, it was his first war and too heavy was for him the responsibility for the survival of the People.<br>
                This is why the prophet went to the front line with the officers and spoke to the people like this: <em>"People chosen by God! Israelites blessed by the Covenant between the Lord and your fathers! Do not falter ! You should trust your Lord after all that He has done for you, and not to tremble like dead leaves in the wind! Has the Lord abandoned you once since you left Egypt? Has he not protected you from Pharaoh's army? Shame on you for forgetting your past and for not following the example of the venerable Moses who kept his Faith and his Confidence in all circumstances! Pray God, Entrust him your lives and He will save them again! No doubt He will defend us! Do not be afraid and be ready "</em>!<br>
                The people found hope thanks to the words of the prophet.<br>
                The Sun was hiding... big gray clouds formed and Lightning struck the enemy catapults which ignited and Suddenly everyone was surprised by the sudden arrival of the ismaelites who had been expelled from this earth, comming back in force in the face of the idolatrous armies which threatened the Israelites.<br>
                The wises Ahmed Panda and Hayce Kioub joined King Ilan ben Renada and Prophet Larry Ben Michael by announcing the good news to them and that it would be necessary to send a hundred men in reinforcement in a few minutes. Everyone saw this unexpected spectacle ... The Indo-Israelite Prince Adrian Ben Yitro on his horse bravely fighting dozens of enemies alone, followed by the Ishmaelites who fought to die to defend the kingdom of God <small>(ברוך הוא וברוך שמו)</small>. A hundred Israeli soldiers arrived as reinforcements and the war ended. The idolatrous armies withdrew and bitterly kept this defeat in memory.<br>
                The Ismaelite people had to leave because by the will of God <small>(ברוך הוא וברוך שמו)</small> they had been expelled. However, they were rewarded with gold, food, weapons and armors.<br>
                King Ilan Ben Renada and Prince Adrian hugged the wises Ahmed Panda and Hayce Kioub before their departure and it was the one and only time in history that the Ishmaelites defended the Israelites, which they entwined like brothers and they gave each other gifts.<br>
                The Lord <small>(ברוך הוא וברוך שמו)</small> addressed the prophet Larry ben Michael in these words: <em>"It was not a miracle which saved them but the brotherhood of Isaac and Ishmael you must not live together but you must love each other by brotherhood because Avraham, despite Ismail's expulsion, loved him very much. Pass this lesson on to my people because the Sages Ahmed Panda and Hayce Kioub are already doing it for the Ismaelites"</em>.
